## Description

I created this daily planner webpage to improve efficiency by blocking out time in the workday! This project gave me the opportunity to incorporate Day.js into my portfolio. It also served as an opportunity to incorporate content, styling and functionality. In creating this daily planner, I was able to practice creating dynamic elements in JavaScript, as well as utilizing local storage for user interactivity.

## Usage

User can utilize the webpage as a daily planner. The page displays the current date and time. The user can enter agenda items into each hourly block as they see fit, and those will be stored for them there.
